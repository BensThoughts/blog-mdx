# Building the ultimate blog

## Introduction

When learning from a tutorial it is often tempting to jump ahead. I have often
found myself jumping from one tutorial to the next, trying to fill in the pieces
I need and leave the rest.  Sometimes this is because a tutorial is incomplete.
Other times this is because I want to implement a feature that the tutorial
doesn't include. By the end of the day the pristine starting point I had is
turned into a real frankenstein of features. Inevitably one feature ends up
conflicting with another and it can be very time consuming to track down which
feature is conflicting with another. It is for this reason that I strongly urge
you to follow this tutorial from start to end on a clean project.

When we focus our attention on one feature at a time we are better able to
diagnose the challenges that arise with implementing that feature.  For this
reason I am going to break this blog entry down into sections based on the
feature that is being implemented.
